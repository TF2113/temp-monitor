Using Chart.js and the accompanying React wrapper, I now have collated data to display on some nice line charts. For now just showing the readings from the last 24 hours but that can be updated to include a dropdown or similar to allow for custom data ranges. 

Using SQL in Spring Boot with JPA makes querying a database extremely easy, either with manual '@Query' method or using the neat feature of deriving the SQL query from the method name using the defined patterns. Isn't technology crazy.

<strong>Up Next - </strong> Add custom date ranges to the graphs & reducing the number of values displayed on the graph (seems a bit cluttered).

Been really loving this album.
