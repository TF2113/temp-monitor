After a silly error of not testing my website worked outside of my home network (oops), I have fixed it. DNS propagation is slowly taking place after restarting my EC2 instance, so it should be resolved soon. Nginx configuration with Docker was a learning experience, although comically simple in hindsight. 

The site is now open to all traffic (for real this time), setting up HTTPS and assigning an API token to the ESP32 is next on the list.
