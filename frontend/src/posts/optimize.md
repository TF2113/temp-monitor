I'm back after a short break, taken some time off after finishing my MSc and having gotten my room monitor to a state that could work autonomously to just relax. Extremely happy to have received a Distinction overall. My final project, the mobility aid, having achieved a Distinction individually to secure the overall classification.  

A side effect of this being that having a device take a reading every minute of every day eventually leads to a lot of data being stored. This caused the 'Monthly' reading history to be extremely slow to load and suffering from performance issues, especially on mobile. Having grown to over 4MB, the GET request was slow to load and render. 

So, I made a month specific endpoint that uses a simple trimming function to only take every 5th entry in the table instead of every reading. Leading to a much smaller request. If I was on LinkedIn I'd probably spit out some buzzword salad like:

"Response payload size and render times were reduced by over 80%, delivering up to a 5Ã— improvement in overall load and visualization performance."

But who wants to read that.

It gets harder every day to resist the urge to buy and play around with a ZX Spectrum. Having visited Glasgow recently, the Riverside Transport Museum of all places had one on display as part of a small Sinclair exhibit to show off the funky Sinclair C5 electric tricycle.

There is something extremely enticing about low-level code to me, maybe its the seemingly arcane aspect of words on a screen having an impact on real hardware that does it. I got to briefly touch on it through bit manipulation and shifting with my final project and small subsequent projects like the ESP32 monitor and learning the STM32 but I want the chance to learn Assembly/BASIC on real, retro hardware. I don't know what it is about the Spectrum that appeals so much, neither I nor anyone in my close family had one growing up but it's stuck with me. 

Anyway, as of writing this the Spotify Embed appears to be having issues, so hopefully its fixed soon.
